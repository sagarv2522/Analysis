Waze‚Äôs free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze‚Äôs community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze‚Äôs business.

Waze‚Äôs data team is working on the churn project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

* Determine the correct modeling approach
* Build a regression model
* Finish checking model assumptions
* Evaluate the model
* Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within Waze

**The goal** is to build a binomial logistic regression model and evaluate the model's performance.
